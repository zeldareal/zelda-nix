 BACKSTORY:

Maple grew up in a cozy mid-sized town surrounded by pine trees and cold mornings. Her parents, Nora and Eli, owned a small cafe called “The Maple Cup,” a warm little spot with chipped mugs, a lot of houseplants, and a bulletin board packed with handwritten ads and doodles. Maple basically grew up behind the counter.

She was the kind of kid everyone liked, not loud, not shy, just nice. She played the drums in the school band, doodled hearts on her notebooks, and complained about school being too hard. She stayed after school to help her mom bake or listen to her dad’s old music on the radio while he made coffee

She *had* (had!! improtant!!) a best friend named Lila, inseparable since kindergarten. They used to talk about moving to the city together one day, maybe opening their own coffee shop or food truck. Maple’s biggest worry was whether she’d make it into the school band next year.

Then the world ended.

When the world started falling apart:
At first, it felt distant. There were news reports about strange outbreaks, and then cities went dark. People joked about it. Maple’s mom even put up a funny “NO ZOMBIES ALLOWED” sign on the cafe door. But when the power went out and the military convoy passed through town, reality hit hard.

Her family tried to stay calm. The cafe had food, a generator, and big windows they could board up. For a while it was pretty nice. They cooked canned soup by candlelight and played cards while sirens howled far, fary away.

Her dad started making cautious scavenging runs. Coffee beans don’t last forever, after all. He returned with supplies and stories about neighbors leaving town. Then one day, he didn’t come back.
Her mom told Maple theyd be fine and that they just needed to wait. So they waited. Days turned into weeks. The streets got quieter and the smell worse. Her mom grew thinner and weaker.

Even during the tough times, Nora tried to keep the cafe “open.” She set out mugs and poured hot water just to pretend customers were still coming. Maple sat at the counter, pretending too. They talked to empty chairs about the weather, about nothing, just to forget what was outside.

When her mom got too sick to get out of bed, Maple read to her old recipe cards, the same way her mom used to read bedtime stories. When Nora finally passed, Maple stayed in the cafe for two more days, cleaning and waiting, not ready to face the silence. But finally, after a while, she took the key, stepped outside, locked the door and started walking.

Now (at time of rp) :
Maple is weirdly functional. She cooks scraps into meals organizes scavenged items and makes a camp feel homey. She talks a lot, tells jokes and hums songs.
Most people find her comforting. Some find her too weird to even talk to.

She’s terrified of silence and will fill it with chatter, humming, or anything else. Nights are the hardest. She keeps the cafe key on a string around her neck and holds it when she can’t sleep.
also she's bisexual *vine boom*
